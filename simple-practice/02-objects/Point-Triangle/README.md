## Tasks

1. A Point class
    1. Create a class named "Point".
    2. Give the `Point` class two member variables, one for x and one for y
       coordinates.
    3. Give the `Point` class any methods necessary.
2. A Triangle class
    1. Create a class named "Triangle".
    2. Give the `Triangle` an array of `Point` objects as a member variable.
        1. The array should hold at least 3 `Point` objects.
    3. When initializing the `Triangle`, be sure to create and set all `Point`
       values.
    4. Give the `Triangle` class any methods that could help. You may want to
       see what is coming up next before continuing.
3. The launcher
    1. Create a class with a meaningful name.
    2. Give the class a main method.
    3. Prompt the user to enter information to create a `Triangle`.
    4. Make a `Triangle` and do the following:
        1. Tell the user what type of `Triangle` it is. The possible types are
           Acute, Obtuse, Right, and Equilateral. This should be stored using
           an enum.
        2. Tell the user the area of the `Triangle`.
