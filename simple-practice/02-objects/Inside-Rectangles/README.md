## Tasks

1. A Point class
    1. Create a class named "Point".
    2. Give the `Point` class two member variables, one for x and one for y
       coordinates.
    3. Give the `Point` class any methods necessary.
2. A Rectangle class
    1. Create a class named "Rectangle".
    2. Give the `Rectangle` class an array of `Point`s, at least four of them.
    3. Feel free to add any methods that may help with the following work.
3. A class to run
    1. Create a class to run this program from, name it whatever you like
       (suggested is RectangleRunner).
    2. Ask the user for enough information to create two `Rectangle` objects.
    3. Once the two `Rectangle` objects are created, tell the user whether
       one of them overlaps the other.
        - If they are overlapping, also tell the user how far one of them has to
          move (in both directions) in order to stop overlapping the other.
