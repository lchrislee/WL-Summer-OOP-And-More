## Tasks

1. Comparing String lengths
	1. Fill in the first TODO by reading in as the phrases that the user wants
	to compare.
	2. Fill in the comparison method, "findLongestString". This method should
	compare the lengths of all the Strings it is given to find the longest one.
	Return the index of the longest String.
	3. For the final TODO (the last one in the main method), retrieve the String
	that we think is the longest so that it can be displayed to the user.
